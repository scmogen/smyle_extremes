# SMYLE Extremes
Notebooks for processing CESM SMYLE to assess forecast skill for Marine Heatwaves (MHW) and Ocean Acidification Extremes (OAX).

CESM SMYLE and SMYLE FOSI are available for download [here](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.cgd.cesm2.smyle.html). OceanSODA-ETHZ is available for download [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/data/0220059/).

All analysis was run in the Python env.yml environment. Before analysis, CESM SMYLE output must be processed and regridded. Extreme thresholds and events can then be generated, and SEDI scores calculated. Results can then be displayed.

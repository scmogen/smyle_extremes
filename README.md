# SMYLE Extremes
Notebooks for processing CESM SMYLE to assess forecast skill for Marine Heatwaves (MHW) and Ocean Acidification Extremes (OAX).

CESM SMYLE and SMYLE FOSI is available for download [here](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/dataset/ucar.cgd.cesm2.smyle.html). OceanSODA-ETHZ is available for download [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/data/0220059/).

Before analysis, CESM SMYLE output must be processed and regridded. Extreme thresholds and events can then be generated, and SEDI scores calculated. Results can then be displayed.
